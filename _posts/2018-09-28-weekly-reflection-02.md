I am starting to get bored with "Intro to CS" because we are starting to do some math stuff. While I know there is a lot of mathematical concepts in coding, I was hoping on continuing with HTML/CSS as I thought that was a lot of fun.

We are currently learning about circles of evaluation, which teaches us about how computers do equations. I think this is an interesting concept because it is not like normal math.

A challenge I'm having is that I'm getting bored of the concepts we are learning, because like I said I would've preferred to work on HTML/CSS stuff.
