![Brandon's Game](/css/WeScheme Image.png)

The screenshot above is my game. The concept is you are a plane, dodging other planes, and collecting flags.

The original program that I was given gave me a backdrop, a title, and different shapes representing a player, a target and an enemy.

I first worked on the title. I created a second "text" image behind it to make it appear 3D, and I changed the text to "Brandon's Game".

After that, I worked on the background. At this time I was playing around with the concepts and eventually decided on doing planes. I searched for a "Wartorn background" and used the one I found.

After that, I edited the shapes. I changed the Player and Enemy to planes, and the target to a flag. I also scaled these down to look more realistic.

Finally, I put them all together in a "put-image" function, so they wouldn't create a new image for every new thing.
