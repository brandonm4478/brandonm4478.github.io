I have had a lot of fun in "Intro to CS" this week, as we are learning many new things.

My biggest challenge is getting to used to "Circles of Evaluation", as it is a weird way to solve equations. I have been practicing it a bit and I'm slowly getting better, but it is still a confusing way to solve equations.

I learned this week more things about racket, especially how to create simple shapes in it.
