To start off, I really like the "Intro CS Class". I've wanted to learn coding for a while (and a Computer Science class). I like the teacher and (most of) the students.

So far I have learned:
• How to use github
• How to create a github repostitory
• How to create a site using CSS and HTML
• How to style a github repository

My biggest challenge so far is that some problems I have aren't online, so I have to figure them out myself.
