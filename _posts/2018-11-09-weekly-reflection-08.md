This week was all about structures (structs), Posns (positions, or (x, y) coordinates), and fast functions.

On monday we talked about a new type of data. In the past we learned about Image Data, Numerical Data and String data. On monday we learned about Posns. A posn is just a coordinate. It contains a x value and a y value. An example contract to make a posn is:

```racket
;make-posn : Number Number â†’ Posn
```

If we input two numbers (x and y values).
