This learning blog will focus on the documentation of my Flag Project. The Flag Project is a program on the website WeScheme. Your task is to create a scaleable verison of a assigned Flag. Here is my flag: https://www.wescheme.org/view?publicId=uh6e7ePpnU

Last week I talked about the flag I was creating, which is the Australian Flag. I talked about how to design it, the geometry of my flag, and what questions or problems I might have. This week, I have finished the flag and now I will talk about the documentation. By the documentation, I mean:
 - What the flag is and what I used to help me create my flag
 - The process I used to create the program/how I create the program
 - What questions/learning moments I had

Before I created the flag, I used this image.
