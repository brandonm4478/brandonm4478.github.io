This week in Intro to CS we went more in depth about creating flags, and we got to create flags for different countries. We also learned more in-depth techniques for making flags, like ellipses.

I made the flags for the Holy Roman Empire, Austria-Hungary, German Empire, and Italy. I think they turned out really well, especially the German Empire Flag.
