Today marks the first third of the semester being completed (or first sixth of the year). A lot has happened in Computer Science class.

We have learned about many things. The first thing we learned about was HTML, CSS, and the fundamentals of a website. We learned about the basic structure of a website, and how the HTML was the structure and the CSS was the paint/decor. We then created this website (which you are reading this blog on). I tried to learn how to go above and beyond with my website, as evident by the background and font.

After that, we moved on to a game design unit, and this is where the bulk of our learning has taken place. To do this we used the WeScheme OpenEditor (https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor). We are currently learning the basics of a coding language called Racket, and will soon move on to creating a game.

So far we have learned about the fundamentals of racket, such as evaluating expressions. An example of what we learned this is the expression 6 / 4 (9 - 2). The way this would look in racket is (* (/ 6 4) (- 9 2)). When you put this in racket, it prints the answer (10.5). 

We have also learned how to define values and turn them into variables. The way to define variables in Racket is (define NAME VALUE/STRING). For example, I can turn the whole equation above into definitions. The way I would do this is:

(define a 6)
(define b 4)
(define c 9)
(define d 2)

(* (/ a b) (- c d))
