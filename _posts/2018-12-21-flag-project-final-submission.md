# Flag of _Australia_ by _Brandon Morgenstein_

## Program Description
**1. What country did you design for?**  
I designed my flag for Australia.
  
**2. What grade do you expect?**  
I expect a 3 out of 4 because while my flag is scaleable and geometrically accurate, it does not 100% use definitions.

## Current program output
